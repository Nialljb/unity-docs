### Contents:
- UNITY data naming SOP
- Getting setup on Flywheel

This is the proposed architectural design. Each local site will push data to their unique project on Flywheel. These projects will form part of a larger group call global map. From here efforts will be made to streamline the process of organising the data into a standardised format (BIDS) and running standardised analysis pipelines. Each project will have their own analysis derivitives (volume estimation etc.) as well as building a larger repository of derived analysis.   
The exact workflow is subject to change and discussions with individual sites is welcomed to ensure all needs are being met.
